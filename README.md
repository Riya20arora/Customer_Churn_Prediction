## 🚀 Steps Performed
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- One-hot encoding
- Train-test split
- Random Forest Classifier
- Evaluation (confusion matrix, classification report)
- Feature importance analysis

## 📈 Model Performance

Achieved ~79% accuracy with Random Forest Classifier.  
Churn was influenced most by features like:
- Contract type
- Tenure
- Monthly Charges
- Tech Support availability

---

## 🧑‍💻 Technologies Used

- Python 3
- pandas, numpy
- scikit-learn
- seaborn, matplotlib
- Google Colab
